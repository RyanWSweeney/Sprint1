Register Page -
The register page can be accessed from the Register button on the login page. In this page, the user can input all of their new data to create their account. When the submit button is clicked, all data the user enters is validated and then added to the users database. The submit button redirects the user to the login page.

Login Page -
The login page is the initial view when accessing the site. Here the user is prompted to enter their username and password to log into the site. There are three buttons here that redirect you to other pages. The first is the submit button, which will sign the user in if they have entered valid login information, and redirects to the home page when pressed. The Forgot Password button redirects the user to the forgot pssword page when they can log in with the security question. The Register button will redirect users to the register page where they will be able to create a new account.

Home page -
The home page is the main view that users will see when signed in. From the home view, there users are able to select from two options. The first option is to submit an application, which will redirect users to the application page and autofill their information. The second button is the edit profile button, which will redirect users to the edit profile page to change any of their information.

Edit page -
The edit page is only accessible from the home page and comes with your information autofilled into text fields. From here, users can change any of their information using the text fields. The changed data is not saved until the users clicks submit, in which case they will be redirected back to the home page.

Application page -
The application page is only accessible from the home page and comes with your information autofilled into text fields. From here, users will be able to choose a class to apply for through the dropdown menu, and upload a resume using the upload button. Upon clicking the submit button, the user's application is stored and the user is redirected back to the home page.
